<h1>Story</h1>
First, in 2020, there was That Fantasy Game I. <br>
Then in 2021 came That Fantasy Game II: ReWorlded and III: Second World. <br>
In 2022, TFG IV: New World was created. <br>
TFG V: Eonwake was left half-finished from early 2023 to the middle of 2024. Rest in peace. <br>
Now comes TFG VI.
<h1>What will it be?</h1>
So, TFG VI is planned to be a dungeon-crawler roguelike, with simultaneous turns and a chemistry-style magic system.
Uh... nothing else?
<h1>Updates</h1>
An alpha release (currently the framework is still being completed) is planned to be released late August.
